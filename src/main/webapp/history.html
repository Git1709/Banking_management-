        <h2>Establishment and Purpose</h2>
        <p>Established on 16 July 1968 by the government to take over the industrial financing activities from the Economic Development Board, the bank's main purpose was to provide loans and financial aid to the manufacturing and processing industries and to help establish and upgrade existing industries in Singapore.</p>

        <h2>Acquisition of POSB Bank</h2>
        <p>Formerly known as Post Office Savings Bank, it was established on 1 January 1877 at the General Post Office Building in Raffles Place by the Straits Settlements government. By 1976, POSB had one million depositors, while deposits crossed the S$1 billion mark.</p>
        <p>The bank was then renamed POSBank in 1990, before being acquired by DBS Bank on 16 November 1998 for S$1.6 billion (first announced on 24 July 1998), giving it a dominant market share with over four million customers.</p>
        
        <h2>The Islamic Bank of Asia (2007 - 2015)</h2>
        <p>DBS Bank launched The Islamic Bank of Asia (IB Asia) on 7 May 2007, after receiving official approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore for a full bank license.</p>
        <p>On 14 September 2015, DBS Bank announced that it will progressively cease IB Asia as it was not able to achieve economies of scale when operated as a single entity. The process was estimated to take about 2 to 3 years. DBS stated that it would develop its own Islamic compliant banking products instead.</p>

        <h2>Digital Banking Disruptions (2023)</h2>
        <p>On 29 March 2023, DBS experienced a service outage that prevented users from using its digital banking services, including its mobile app and PayLah! app, from about 8.30 am until about 5.45 pm.</p>
        <p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) stated that the disruption was "unacceptable" and that the bank had fallen short of MAS's expectations that the bank would maintain "high system availability and ensure its IT systems are recovered expeditiously".</p>
        <p>The regulator stated that it would "take the commensurate supervisory actions against DBS after gathering the necessary facts".</p>
